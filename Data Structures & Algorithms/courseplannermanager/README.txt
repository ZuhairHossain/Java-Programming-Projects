Purpose Description:
 	• In this assignment, you will write a course planner for Stony Brook students. 
 	The planner is simply a list where students can record the courses they want to take in order of preference. 
	A course contains general information such as course name, course code, course section, instructor, etc. 
	We will simplify the course to include these basic information. 
	The planner should be able to record a total of 50 courses, a number which should be declared as a final variable.


 	• Please take a look at the "SampleInput-Output.pdf" file for an example of how the program is ran.
