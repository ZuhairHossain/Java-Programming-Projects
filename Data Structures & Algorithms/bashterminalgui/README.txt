Purpose Description:

	• In this assignment, you will be modeling a file system using a ternary (3-child) tree data structure. In most operating systems, files are stored in directories.
	These directories may contain other directories along with files.

	In addition to a file system, an OS typically also provides a shell, which is an interface allowing you to run programs and move through the file system. You are likely very familiar with a Graphical User Interface, or GUI, to interact with your host, although a much simpler interface is sometimes all that is required.
	
	In Unix-based operating systems, the Bourne-again shell, or bash, is a terminal-based shell allowing you to run programs by typing commands into a terminal prompt. An example of a bash terminal is shown in the provided below, from a machine running Ubuntu 15.04, a linux distribution. In this assignment, you will implement a very simple bash shell providing a few very basic functions allowing you to interact with your file system.


 	• There are two main programs: BashTerminal.java & BashTerminalGUI.java->(PACKAGE: “bashterminalgui”)

 	• BashTerminalGUI.java is ran on NetBeans IDE 8.0.2, and for some reason NetBeans sometimes gives me problems with spaces and indents, please don’t mind that if my program turns out to be like that when you open it, as I have already fixed that on my machine.

 	• BashTerminal.java is the console version of HW5, with use of Scanner from java API for user-input

 	• BashTerminalGUI.java is the GUI version of HW5, with use of JavaFX from java API

 	• BashTerminalGUI.java: Enter your desired Terminal Input & Click on the button “Enter Command Input” to process your input. If you would like to exit the terminal, please click on the “Exit” button on the right, as will be specified in the output from the terminal output in the middle.

 	
 	• If you want to exit, click “Exit button at right pane.

	*** Please take a look at the "SampleInput-Output.pdf" file for an example of how the program is ran.
