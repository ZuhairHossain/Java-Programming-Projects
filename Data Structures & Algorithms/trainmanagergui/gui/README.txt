Purpose Description:
 	• In this assignment, you will write a train car manager for a commerical train. 
 	The train, modelled using a Double-Linked List data structure, consists of a chain of train cars, each of which contains a product load. 
 	A product load has a weight, a value, and can be dangerous or safe. 
 	The train car manager will be able to add and remove cars from the train, set the product load for each car, and determine useful properties of the train, such as it's length, weight, total value, and whether it contains any dangerous product loads.

 	• TrainManager.java is the console version of this program & TrainManagerGUI.java is the GUI version of this program
 	
 	• Please take a look at the "SampleInput-Output.pdf" file for an example of how the program is ran.
